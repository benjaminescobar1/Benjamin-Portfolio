# <Benjamin-Portfolio>

## Description

This portofolio is to demonstrate creating a functional webpage from scratch without any starter code provided. The portfolio provides a about me, work and contact me section for potentional employers to view. The coding on the webpage focuses on both HTML and CSS. When clicking on the header links it will navigate the user to the correct section of the page. When hovering over the images the images fade in color to indicate that section of the application is being hovered. Also, when clicking on the application images it'll deploy to the website that corresponds the to image. Since I do not have any background my main application under work is a mock up from our first assignment of the bootcamp. This portfolio gives a brief discription of my background, work and ways to contact me for employers.
